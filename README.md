# DeliveryRoute
Front End portion of a group project application that served as a way for the user to calculate a route to take based on multiple 
destination inputs. The user would be able to enter several cities and a route would be created that would take the shortest path. 

The files in this repo were used as the user interface for the applcation.

The project gave an opportunity to learn about and implement Dijkstra's Shortest Path algorithm.
